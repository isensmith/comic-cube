# COMIC-CUBE README

Hello! Thank you so much for checking out this project and opening this README. 

The origin of this idea is comic books, specifically the medium of the physical comic book and the wonderful, individual, beloved shops that sell them. Every year, tons of comic book stores close their doors, many of them after years of just barely scraping by. It’s not a high profit business, selling comics, and most of the people who own and run a comic shop do so purely for the love of it. 

## What are we doing? (And why?)
One Wednesday (new comic book day) while browsing the “Week 1” wall, i found an issue #2 of a book that i instantly loved but i’d missed #1. I had no idea it was even coming out, and worse, it was not even the first time this happened to me. It struck me that what i needed was an app that would easily tell me the new books coming out and which i could use to instantly box a copy at my local shop. It also occured to me that with a tool like this i’d buy more comics and the shop would make more money. Win win!

## Who are we?
I’m Ren, a long time comic book collector and tech nerd. I’ve worked as a front end web dev for years. I’m also passionate about keeping local brick and mortar “mom & pop” stores alive. They are often the color and culture of a city and always a more interesting shopping experience than big box stores (except Walmart tho, things can get surreal at a Walmart). 

## What do we need?
We need programmers who understand infrastructure and can forge the path forward with the big picture in mind. What’s the best platform to build this on for the most effortless integration into smallbusiness retailer’s current systems?

## Understand the jargon
"**Box**" - The box at your local retailer where they will hold things you’ve specified they order and reserve for you until you come to purchase and take them home. 

"**Pull List**" - The list of items that are available individually, or in a series, which you have specified to your retailer you wish they order and reserve for you in your Box.
